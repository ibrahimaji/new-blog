I always wanted to try trail running, but I'm too lazy to trail running alone. After my friend invited me to trail running, I directly accept it.

## The Plan

Our planning is go to Puncak Welirang with estimated 10 km from start position. I bring myself light running vest, 2 boiled eggs, 2 energy gel, and 3 soft flask with mineral water. I don't have any trail running shoes, so I use my cheap running shoes.

## The Run

I thought this is not a trail run, just a ordinary hiking because we are not running at all! Me and my 3 friends have different background. My 2 friends is 3 times to go there, so it is not difficult for them. I myself never go there, but with my running experience I can keep up with my 2 friends. My 1 friend was very struggling because he hasn't prepared well especially for physical condition. So we frequently stopped.
At a checkpoint, we agreed to go down again and not continue to the summit. Not only because my friend condition, but also the weather is likely to be rain.

## Conclusion

Trail running preparation is needed more than regular running. I need to have more food and drink preparation as well as physic preparation. We will back strong to conquer the summit!
